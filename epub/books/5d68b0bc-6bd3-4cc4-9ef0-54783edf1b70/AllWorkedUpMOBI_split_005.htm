   <p class="ChapterHeading-Digital">Chapter Two</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As Candace closed the gap between them, and the sight of Mr. Shirtless’s sculpted back muscles and tight sexy ass came into view, moisture broke out on her skin and she suspected it had little to do with the early-morning sun beating down on her. This scrumptious display of man had her mind wandering, envisioning that toned body climbing over her, his mouth crashing down on hers while those big hands of his used her hips for leverage as he powered his cock into her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With her mind preoccupied and her knees turning to rubber, it was all she could do to maintain a coherent thought. Totally thrown off her stride as she approached the first turn, Candace faltered. Cripes! Before she could slow her pace and find stability she went flying forward. Arms flailing, looking for something to grip on to, her momentum sent her off the beaten path and onto the grassy embankment fringing the lake. Unfortunately not the fall, or the friction of her body sliding over the leafy blades, could slow her down or stop her from sailing head first into the water.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">How. Totally. Frigging. Embarrassing.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She opened her mouth to scream but only managed to gurgle as she plunged to the bottom of the lake. The water rushed over her, seeping into her clothes and sneakers and splashing over the bank as she tried to find her footing.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When her feet finally connected with the sandy bottom, she pushed herself out of the water, praying Mr. Shirtless had missed the action and was halfway around the track by now. But when her lids flew open, her stomach plummeted, her day having just gone from bad to worse.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He stood at the embankment, staring down at her. “Jesus, are you okay?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When she saw genuine concern in his eyes, something inside her softened, and a burst of foreign emotions took a lazy stroll through her body, catching her off guard. Goodness, no man had ever looked at her like that before, with such worry in his eyes, such warmth and compassion, and she didn’t quite know what to make of his careful regard.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Feeling color blossom on her cheeks, Candace wiped her bangs from her face and blinked a big drop of water from her lashes. She shook off the adrenaline rush and nodded. “Yes, I’m fine.” At least her body was. She couldn’t say the same for her ego.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“What happened?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Without censoring her words and somewhat rattled by the strange way he made her feel, she blurted out, “It was all your fault.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His head jerked back. “How was it my fault?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I didn’t expect to see you on the track.” Candace pulled the buds from her ears, removed her wet iPod from her arm and tossed them onto the grass. Damn thing was probably ruined.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He cocked his head. “Again, how is that my fault?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Deciding she’d said too much and completely flustered by the whole incident, she looked at him and took note of his sexy smile. “What?” she asked.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His grin widened. “Nothing. It’s nothing.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“If it’s nothing, then why are you grinning at me like that?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He shrugged, and his eyes raced over her clothes. In that instant her nipples hardened, and she wondered if he noticed her arousal through her training jacket. So much for the crystal blue water cooling down her lustful body. She was pretty damned sure she’d just heated the entire lake up a few degrees.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I don’t know. I guess it’s because you look like a drowned cat.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Thanks,” she shot back and tried to smooth her hair from her face. “I’m glad I could amuse you with my appalling state.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Not appalling. Adorable.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Oh.” Inexplicably, something in the way he said “adorable” brought warmth to her face, not to mention one other part of her body.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <i class="calibre2">He thinks I’m adorable.</i>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With the back of his hand, he wiped perspiration from his brow. She took pleasure in the sexy shift of his muscles and the heat in his dark eyes as they raked over her. Fire whipped through her veins and she dropped deeper into the water, a futile attempt to tamp down the flames.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Here give me your hand. Let me help you.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As he reached for her and she saw those big, strong callused hands of his, she did a quick tally. One, it was his fault she’d faltered in the first place. Two, he did get to see her all wet and aroused. And three, he too looked like he could use a little cooling off.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His palm closed over hers and he gave slight tug. She in turn braced her feet, gave a tug of her own and stepped aside as he came crashing into the water next to her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">A moment later he found his footing and stood. His gaze locked on hers and he wiped the water from his eyes. “What the hell—?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His voice fell off and she guessed he’d read her desire, taking note of the way she was looking at him with longing in her eyes. Water dripped down his chest and she practically salivated, aching to trail those tiny droplets with the tip of her tongue. The cool water settled just above his waistband, prohibiting her from seeing the wet outline of his cock. She swallowed and resisted the urge to dive under the surface for a glimpse. Jesus, she couldn’t believe how lusty her thoughts had turned. A result of no sex for the last few months, she supposed.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She did a brief perusal of the area. All was quiet. Not a runner to be found. When she turned back to him, he ran his tongue over his bottom lip, drinking in the refreshing splashes of Blueberry Lake from his mouth. Her gaze centered on his luscious lips and her libido roared for attention, demanding she do something about her sex life or lack thereof.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Maybe one little kiss, one quick romp in the water would help clear her head. Heck, it wasn’t in her nature to just jump into bed with a man—a stranger, at that—and she could hardly believe the direction her brain had gone. After all, she didn’t even know his name. Then again, maybe that was a good thing. He was nearly finished with the job at the inn and come nightfall she’d never set eyes on him again. Tomorrow she’d be refreshed and ready to go back to celibate Candace, no one the wiser that she’d gotten a little sidetracked.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He must have read her mind. His eyes darkened and turned serious. She watched his throat work as he swallowed, and he moved a measured step closer. As his body loomed over hers, he dipped his head and for a brief moment she thought he was going to kiss her. He reached out and pushed her hair off her face. She tipped her head to meet his gaze, and when a low moan rose up from her throat, something flashed in his eyes and he hesitated. A second later he gave his head a brisk shake, as if to clear it. Then he took a distancing step back and walked to the embankment.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">What the heck?</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“So we’re even then?” Even though he’d tried for light, she could hear the underlying lust in his voice.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Even? Why would we be even?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You said it was my fault you fell into the lake. I can only assume that’s why you pulled me in here with you. To square things up? A little tit for tat?” When she didn’t respond, he turned to her. “Wasn’t that your reason, Candace?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Yeah, that was my reason.” One of many, but he didn’t need to know that just yet. Then something else occurred to her and she tightened, memories of the threatening letters filling her thoughts. Suddenly feeling very foolish and very vulnerable, she questioned, “How do you know my name?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Without missing a beat he said, “I heard your friends call out to you. Earlier, at the inn.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Oh, right.” She’d forgotten he was within earshot when Lindsay and Anna had greeted her as she stretched on the front lawn.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I’m Marc. Marc Collins.” He held his hand out, and as she shook it, she studied him a moment. Good guys were rare, but something in her gut told her Marc Collins just might be one of them, not that she’d always been such a great judge of character. But he had a strength of character about him, unlike the men she usually found herself attracted to. It also occurred to her that he gave off a protective vibe, making her feel absurdly safe with him. Truthfully, there was something about this man. Something trustworthy and fiercely protective that put her at ease.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Intuition told her she had nothing to fear from him. That he was a gentleman, a man of integrity. She considered things a minute longer. Marc was a paint stripper hired by Pamina, not some aspiring actor using her to get close to her father—heck he didn’t even respond to her advances, which proved he was different from any other man she’d ever met. And the painstaking care he took with his work proved he was a skilled laborer.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace was pretty damn certain he didn’t know who she was. Was there a chance there could be something more between them, that he could like her for who she really was, not for her daddy’s power and influence? Damned if she didn’t want to find out. But sadly, he hadn’t tried to hit on her. Even when presented with the opportunity.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">That was definitely something she’d have to rectify.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc mentally gave himself a good hard scolding and lectured himself on keeping his hands off her, despite the sexual sparks arcing between them. What the hell had he been thinking? He’d nearly kissed her. Thank God common sense had dictated, and sound reason found its way back into his brain before he did something he’d regret later. Yeah, later. Because he certainly wouldn’t regret it while he was doing it with her. Oh no. Not at all. If he had her in his arms, he’d enjoy every damn minute of it. Exploring that curvaceous body of hers, kissing that lush mouth, running his thumbs and his tongue over her gorgeous pink nipples. Yeah, he’d glimpsed those pert buds through her track jacket. All hard and swollen and begging for his mouth.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His cock swelled almost painfully, and he shifted to hide his arousal. Marc clenched his jaw to stifle a moan and moved to the embankment. He turned to her. “Need a hand?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her eyes snapped up, as if she too had been lost in thought. “No, I’m good, thanks.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She climbed from the water and he followed behind her. She grabbed her iPod, murmured something under her breath about it being ruined, and walked to the running track. When she reached the trail, she turned to him, soaking wet. A cool fall breeze blew over them and she gave a slight shiver. As he took in the bedraggled sight of her, his protective instincts kicked into high gear. Sure he was a security specialist, a bodyguard for a living, but whatever had suddenly come over him went deeper than that. Candace was strong and capable, but there was a guarded vulnerability in her eyes that really got to him. Had she been hurt in the past?</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She jerked her thumb toward the inn. “I need to head back.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I’m with you on that.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace scanned the length of him, then her eyes widened, almost apologetically. “I never thought. You probably don’t have a change of clothes with you.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I do. In my van. I come equipped.” He neglected to tell her that his van also came equipped with a security camera, recording their actions even now, as they stood there staring at each other.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She exhaled a relieved breath and began to make her way back. “Good. I’d hate to cost you a day’s work by having you go home to change.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Jesus, how refreshing. Marc was used to hanging around pampered movie stars who didn’t give a rat’s ass if their actions resulted in him losing a day’s work. Candace really was different from those divas. She seemed so natural, so down to earth.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc hurried his steps to catch up and decided to probe for information. If he was going to protect her without her knowledge, he needed to know more about her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“How long have you been a designer?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Officially for about five years now. Although, in reality more like twenty-five.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Twenty-five?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She laughed. “Yeah, Lindsay, Anna and I have been tearing our rooms apart and putting them back together since we were kids.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Testing her, he said, “Your mom and dad must have loved that.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Oh, they sure did. I can’t tell you how many times they grounded me until I put everything in order again.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">The fact that she included her father in the picture didn’t elude him. “Tell me, Candace, what do you do for fun in Mason Creek?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You mean you’re not from around here?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Damn. So much for blending in as a local and keeping his cover. It was a small town, yet still big enough that not everyone knew everyone else. “I’m new in town. Been sleeping in my van until my new shop is ready.” He resisted the urge to cringe at his bold-faced lie.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“New shop?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Yeah, new workshop,” he said, not bothering to elaborate.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Your parents aren’t from around here?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“No. We’re from the city.” He neglected to tell her which city.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Relatives?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“No.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Then what brings a city boy to Mason Creek?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He gestured toward his van. “Work. So you never did tell me what you do around here for fun.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Ignoring his comment, she said, “Maybe once we get the inn finished, you’ll be able to get a room until your place is ready.” She crinkled her nose and her green eyes glistened in the sunlight. “On the other hand, maybe it’s not such a great idea.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Why?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Well, I never thought to consider—”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Consider what?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“That any of the rooms would appeal to you.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He furrowed his brow, confused. “Why wouldn’t they appeal to me?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“It’s just that, well, we’re designing fantasy-inspired theme rooms.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">That took him by surprise. “Really?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace grinned. “Yeah, really.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You mean to tell me Pamina hired you to create sex rooms?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She nodded and chuckled lightly, obviously enjoying the easy flow of conversation as much as he was. “I know. Who would have thought? She doesn’t seem the type, does she?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly intrigued, he said, “Speaking of types, tell me more about these rooms and exactly what you’re planning on doing with yours.”</p>
