   <p class="ChapterHeading-Digital">Chapter Four</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With her legs rubbery and a permanent smile etched on her flushed face, Candace made her way back to the inn, Marc at her side. A comfortable silence fell over them as birds chirped and nestled in the huge apple trees beside the house. Juicy red apples weighed down the branches and glistened beneath the sun. Candace did a double take. She had a designer’s eye that took in everything, but she certainly couldn’t remember ever seeing those ripe trees before.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When she reached the front lawn she turned to Marc, and the heated look in his eyes had her aching to go back to the lake, to touch and kiss him all over, the way he’d touched and kissed her. Her mouth watered and liquid heat poured through her veins in anticipation.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He nodded toward the power tools. “I’d better get back to work.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Me too,” she said, not really interested in moving anywhere without him but knowing she needed to get the painting completed before Marc finished the bed and brought it inside. They also had to work together to install the hanging sex swing, position the love glider and Tantra chair. All devices that combined sex and exercise. Not to mention the already installed floor-to-ceiling pole, which was perfect for dancing, an excellent cardiovascular workout.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc leaned close and for a second she thought he was going to kiss her, then once again she saw something in his eyes before he stepped back, abruptly. Hesitation. One minute he was making crazy love to her with his hands and mouth, and the next he was pulling back, physically and emotionally. The same way he had earlier, during their first trip into the water.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">A loud noise inside the house drew their attention, and Candace jumped. Marc laughed and his knuckles brushed her skin, a comforting gesture. “There seems to be quite a bit of banging going on up there.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She wouldn’t mind doing a little banging of her own. “Must be Brad tearing down that wall.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc inclined his head, and heat churned in his eyes. “Yeah, must be,” he agreed, his voice deeper, huskier. When she caught the strange look moving over his face, she followed his gaze. For a brief second she thought she caught the outline of Lindsay pressed against the window, but the image disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc cleared his throat, suddenly flustered, and she wondered exactly what he’d seen in that window. What was going on up there?</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You’d better get back at it,” he said. “I’m close to finishing the bedframe.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With that they both went back to the task at hand. Candace made her way through the old house, calling out to Pamina but unable to find her anywhere. Everyone was hard at work, she supposed. She hurried up the gorgeous winding staircase, climbed into her coveralls and readied her supplies.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Now here she was, her mind wandering, thinking about how she wanted to set up the furniture and how she’d like to try out every sinful piece with Marc. God, she couldn’t believe how intimate she’d been with him, a man she barely knew but felt completely comfortable with. A man who was concerned with her needs and desires, and admitted that pleasuring her had pleasured him. Nor could she believe how he’d so easily read her, and the excitement she felt from having sex outdoors with the possibility of getting caught. A fine shiver moved down her spine and she knew she wanted to do that again.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He had to be some visiting alien, she decided.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">But seriously, who was he and where had he come from? He’d only recently moved to Mason Creek. Where had he moved from, and where exactly was this shop he was setting up? Perhaps Pamina would know, since she’d hired him in the first place.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">And why did he go from hot to cold so quickly, displaying passion one second and hesitation the next?</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As she pondered that longer, wondering if past hurts were holding him back, Candace wiped her brow, then put the finishing touches on the back wall. She stood back to admire her work. Satisfied with the job and happy she was half-done with only two walls left, she glanced out the window and spotted Marc walking to his van. Would he be sleeping in there tonight? She noted the king-sized mattress on her floor, brand-new sheets and plush comforter beside it. Sure the room wasn’t ready yet, but even if he didn’t get the frame made, there was no reason why he couldn’t crash on that perfectly comfortable makeshift bed.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Returning to matters, Candace went to work on finishing her painting just as Abra came sauntering into the room.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Hey, kitty.” She stopped to give him a pat.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Abra curled around her legs, brushing up against her and purring in delight. She stroked his massive underbelly and made a tsking sound.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You know, Abra, maybe you should come on one of my runs. It wouldn’t hurt you to shed a few pounds.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With that he hissed and hopped up onto her windowsill, where he gave her his back and proceeded to groom himself.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace laughed at his ornery behavior. “You really are a strange kitty.” Paying him no more attention, she went back to painting. Day bled into night as Candace completed the walls and cleaned up her supplies. The grumbling of her stomach told her it was dinnertime.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When she heard loud banging noises coming from Lindsay’s room, she thought about investigating, but Anna popped her head in, her cheeks flushed, her big blue eyes wide and glossy.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You okay?” Candace asked and furrowed her brow in concern.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Fine, just wanted to let you know I can’t meet up for dinner after all. Looks like we’ll be working well into the night.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace frowned. Lindsay had been unable to join them for lunch and she could only assume she was still too busy to quit for the night. “Is your project going okay? Do you need help?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“No,” Anna rushed out. “We’re right on schedule. But my masonry guy doesn’t want to leave smack-dab in the middle of the…job.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Okay, so why did she pause before saying <i class="calibre2">job</i>? What exactly was going on in there anyway? Not that it was any of Candace’s business. After all, she’d broken the pact. Or had she? Did oral sex count as breaking the pact? Nah, she didn’t think so. She’d simply dented it. Only full-blown intercourse counted as breaking it, right?</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <i class="calibre2">And if she’d gone so far as to dent it…</i>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Will you be driving home tonight?” Anna asked.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Yeah, why? Do you want me to wait and give you a lift?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“No, I just wouldn’t want to keep you up with any noise next door. Laying brick can get noisy.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“No worries, I’m heading home.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I’ll see you in the morning,” she said, a twinkle in her eye as she disappeared. Feeling fatigued, Candace carried her brushes to the washtub on the main level, off the laundry area, and rinsed them out. Once her task was complete, she pulled off her coveralls, hopped into a warm shower and washed herself up before heading back to the room to climb into a fresh pair of clothes, which she always brought with her when there was a possibility of staying overnight on a job. She moved through the old inn in search of Pamina but when she couldn’t find her, she stepped out into the night.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">A refreshing burst of cool evening air brushed over her, giving her a second wind, and her eyes went from Marc’s van to the track and back to his van again. There was nothing she liked better than a brisk run after sunset, then maybe she’d grab something to eat.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She wondered if Marc was interested in eating with her…</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc paced in his van with half of his brain kicking his ass for his stupidity at the lake and the other half unable to stop thinking about the way Candace had felt in his arms or tasted on his tongue. Wincing, he threw himself into his small desk chair and ran his hands through his hair, noting that the erotic scent of her still lingered on his skin. Jesus…</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Restless in his wobbly seat, he moved from side to side and turned on his security monitors. Apprehension moved through him as he zeroed in on the camera overlooking the lake. Son of a bitch! He’d been so caught up in the moment he’d forgotten the camera had been on them, recording their every salacious action. He held his hand over the delete button, knowing he had to remove any evidence of them together, but then suddenly, he couldn’t seem to bring himself to do it just yet. Perhaps a quick look, purely for research purposes, he assured himself, to confirm that the cameras were in working order before he deleted the entire file. He hit the rewind button, taking it back to the exact time he’d jumped into the water.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">The erotic sight of him pleasuring Candace came on screen and he immediately hardened. His cock thickened and his balls tightened, demanding he finally do something about his rock-hard erection before he went off like a supernova.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Groaning and feeling like a hormonal teenager, he slipped his hands inside his shorts, gripped his cock and began to stroke himself. Hard. If he wanted to get his mind back on the job, the only way to do it was with a clear head. Both of them. And if this was the answer, then so be it.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When he heard Candace’s cries of ecstasy, he pumped faster, the need to release the brewing pressure inside him growing at an alarming rate. Another low groan crawled out of his throat as he worked his palm over his throbbing cock. He closed his eyes briefly, letting his wild imagination take him back to that lake with Candace.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Erotic visions of the way she’d offered herself to him filled his thoughts; her pussy poised at his mouth and his fingers pumping inside her and brushing over her G-spot until she quaked with urgency. Jesus he loved how he’d made her quake.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He opened his eyes in time to watch the way he licked her pussy, his face moving between her thighs and inching open her swollen lips as he ravished her sweet spot. With his senses exploding he dragged in air and knew his orgasm was only a stroke away. His hands began to work harder over his dick as he fantasized how it would feel to slide his cock into her tight sex, and pump in and out of her until they both shattered into a million pieces, their orgasms overtaking them and leaving them drained, sated.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Fuck…” He moaned out loud as pressure mounted inside him. He cupped his sac and stroked his dick faster. With his cock thickening to the point of no return, he bit down on his bottom lip, his brain no longer functioning.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">But then, seconds before he found release, a knock came on his door and had his mind careening back. He grunted something incoherent, summoned what little brainpower he had left and flicked off the monitors, praying that whoever was on the other side of that door hadn’t heard anything.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">The knock came again, and he worked to stuff his swollen cock back into his shorts and adjust his T-shirt to hide the huge bulge.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Marc, are you in there?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Holy hell!</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He cleared his throat. “Yeah, just a second,” he bit out and drew on an old teenage trick, thinking about sports and old television shows, in an effort to shrink his erection.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Is everything okay?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Hell no, everything wasn’t okay. Here he was whacking off in a van while he watched himself pleasure his boss’s daughter on video. Not only that. He liked her. Really liked her. Candace was open, giving, fun and refreshing. She was natural and lacked pretense. So unlike any other woman he’d ever met. And what was he doing in return? Deceiving her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Yeah, I’ll be right out.” After taming his arousal, he erased the video, drew a centering breath and pulled open the door. He stepped out and inched the door closed behind him, but the minute she leaned forward, breaching his personal space, a rush of sexual energy hit him. Hard.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“What was that noise I heard?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Feeling flustered, something that never happened to him—until he set eyes on Candace, that is—he rushed out. “Radio…yeah, the radio.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She tried to look past his shoulders, but he moved, blocking her path and slamming his door tight.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Are you finished for the day?” she asked.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“All done.” He put his hands into the pockets of his shorts to inconspicuously adjust himself. Christ, everything about her reduced him to a hormonal juvenile.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I was just thinking about taking a run, then afterwards grabbing something to…<i class="calibre2">eat</i>.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc’s heart missed a beat as he took in the lust in her eyes and something about the way she said <i class="calibre2">eat</i> had his libido roaring to life once again. He should say no and just get the hell out of there and ask his boss to put someone else on the case. But he didn’t trust anyone else to look out for her. <i class="calibre2">Or touch her.</i></p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">That last thought made him realize he’d gotten himself in deep.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Too deep.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">If he knew what was good for him, he’d just get the fuck out of Dodge. Tonight.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She began to back up, picking up the pace to give herself a head start. “Come on. I’ll race you to the lake. Winner takes all,” she said with a mischievous gleam in her eyes. When she turned her back to him and took off on a flat-out run, he bent down and tightened his laces.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">So it would appear he <i class="calibre2">didn’t</i> know what was good for him, after all.</p>
