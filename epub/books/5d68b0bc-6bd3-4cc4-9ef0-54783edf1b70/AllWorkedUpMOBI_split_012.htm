   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Interior decorator Lindsay Bell jumped at the chance to help restore the old inn at Mason Creek. What could be more fun than letting her imagination run wild on an unlimited budget? Eagerly she plans to turn her assigned room into a fantasy BDSM playground.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">All she expected from her newly hired handyman was to help her tear down a support wall. She certainly didn’t expect Brad Caldwell to be so drop-dead gorgeous in a tool belt. When he proves to be a steady, hardworking, stand-up guy—unlike the men she’s dated—Lindsay has a new and wicked idea.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">To take her new creation on a test drive down the road of their deepest, darkest, most delicious desires—and seduce her way into his heart.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <i class="calibre2">Warning: Smokin’ hot sex with creative use of toys, and a dash of magic.</i>

    <i class="calibre2">Enjoy the following excerpt for</i> All Tied Up:</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He shut the door. Lindsay’s eyes widened at the sound of the lock clicking in place. He could almost see her body stir to life. Almost hear her mind reeling with possibilities.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“What—”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">In two long strides he closed the distance between them and pressed his fingers to her lips. “Shh.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He watched her throat work as she swallowed and knew, by the heated look in her eyes, her untamed passion and desires matched his. She wanted this as much as he did. No questions about it.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He gripped her slim waist and packaged her soft body against his. Christ, she felt so incredible in his arms, he could only imagine how wonderful she’d feel trapped between his legs. Nudging her feet with his, he backed her up until the rear of her knees hit the padded table. Eyes wide, questioning, her chest rose and fell with her erratic breathing.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He tugged her T-shirt out from her tight jeans. When his fingers connected with her soft skin, his brain nearly shut down. “I’m going to give you what you want, Lindsay.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her voice hitched, color bloomed high on her cheeks. “How do you know what I want?” He heard the intrigue in her voice and felt her hips push against him. It was a slight movement but hadn’t gone unnoticed.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He offered her a slow smile. “You’re going to have to trust me on that one.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I can’t possibly see—”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He pitched his voice low and demanded in a deep tone. “Take off your clothes. Nice and slow.” He touched her arm and felt her body shake with excitement.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You’ve got to be kidding me?” Her voice betrayed her emotions. He could see the passion, the invitation building in her eyes.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He shook his head. “Not even for a minute.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Brad—”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Take them off, Lindsay. Now. Nice and slow like I told you. If you don’t follow the rules, I’m afraid you’ll be punished.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He slid his hand between her legs and cupped her sex, just to prove just how serious he was.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">An edgy laugh morphed into a heated moan. He noted the way her legs wobbled. “<i class="calibre2">Sweet mother of God</i>,” she whispered under her breath. Then she starched her spine and met his glace. “What if I don’t want to?” Her voice lacked conviction. They both knew it.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He trailed his finger over her arm and felt the goose bumps on her flesh. “You do. Now take them off. Then I want you sprawled out on that bench. I want you naked, hot and wet, and begging me to fuck you.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Ohmigod,” he heard her gasp as his lips closed over hers for a deep, intense, mind-numbing kiss. He slipped his tongue inside her delicious mouth and spent a long moment just tasting her lush sweetness. Jesus, he wanted to devour her. All of her. Right now.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Lindsay inched back, her eyes clouded with emotion, her voice breathless. “This can only be about sex, Brad. Just to help ease the tension between us. Nothing more.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Naturally,” he agreed, lightheartedly, feeling anything but. He might have readily agreed with her, the truth was, he wanted to see where this led them. With that he gave her a gentle push.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Lindsay landed on the bench, her legs spread. Brad let out an agonized groan as his groin tightened and throbbed in heated anticipation. Jesus, he’d never felt such intense desire before. It took all his strength and willpower not to act on his natural urges and answer the demands of his body. At the moment he’d like nothing more than to strip her clothes off, spread her legs wide open and sink his cock into her damp heat. Honestly, it practically killed him not to ravish her caveman style, to push inside her pussy and fuck her until sundown. But, right now, this was about Lindsay, so he needed to control those urges for the time being.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He growled low in his throat as she sat there, eyes glazed with lust as she awaited his instructions. God dammit he wanted her. So much so that he ached to the point of pain. He took a moment to get himself under control before he fucked her with wild abandon.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Obviously not wanting to give him time to catch up and anxious to get the game started, she asked, “What is it you’d like me to do?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">It didn’t take her long to assume her role of submissive, which led him to believe she’d been fantasizing about this for quite some time. It also led him to believe no man had ever taken the time to get to know her on a deeper lever and understand her needs and desires. Stupid bastards. With a girl this incredible, this amazing, a guy had to be a total asshole not to spend all his time getting to know the real her. And give her what she wanted.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Take you pants off and then resume that position.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Lindsay obliged without hesitation. She lowered herself onto her back and brought her legs onto the bench. She unsnapped her pants, pulled the zipper and wiggled her gorgeous, curvy ass. Once her jeans were at her ankles she kicked them away. Without inhibition, she sprawled across the bench. He was pleased at how comfortable she was in her own skin. He met her glance. The look in her eyes conveyed without words just how excited she was. Which pleased him immensely.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Brad walked around her, devouring her with his eyes. With exquisite gentleness, he touched her bare legs, his fingers trailing lightly over her soft skin, going higher and higher, coming perilously close to her pussy. Her body quaked. Her legs inched open in invitation.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He lowered his voice. “Very, very nice.” He inhaled and could already smell the tang of her arousal.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Brad please,” she begged, and reached for him, her fingers brushing against his throbbing cock.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He shackled her hands and put them to her sides. “Sit up,” he commanded. “And take off your shirt.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Lindsay sat up, her legs wide open, straddling the bench. As he took in the sight of her, he thought he’d go mad with want. The need to fuck her made him edgy, shaky.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He swallowed and worked to control his voice. “Spread your legs wider.” She did, but it wasn’t nearly wide enough for him to have a full, unobstructed view of her sweet spot. “Wider, Lindsay,” he whispered his glance going to the unpacked box of BDSM toys in the corner of the room. “If you’re not going to listen, I’ll have to punish you.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her face flushed from heat, her dark eyes glazed with passion. A soft mewl caught in her throat. He stroked her again. Her body buzzed, her skin felt hot to the touch.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She shimmied to the end of the bench and spread her legs impossibly wider, offering her pussy up to him so nicely.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“That’s a girl.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Twin folds opened for him, affording him a view of her luscious pink softness. Jesus, her pussy was drenched with desire. He did this to her. Damn that pleased him, knowing he could raise her passions to such height and make her soaked with need.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He lowered himself to his knees to get a better look. He leaned in and inhaled, pulling her feminine scent into his lungs. Then he blew a warm breath over her pussy. Her damp hairs bristled.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She drew a shaky breath. “Oh God,” she whispered and tilted her pelvis forward, an obvious plea for more.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her heat beckoned him and he wanted to touch her. No. He needed to touch her. If he didn’t soon feel her softness, he was certain an artery would blow. His jeans tightened painfully reminding him just how much he wanted her, just how much she affected him. Brad couldn’t ever remember feeling so crazed, so out of control.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He drew a breath, gathering himself. “You are incredible, babe,” he breathed the words over her pussy and watched her sex muscles tighten and throb.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">After a light brush of his knuckle over her swollen clit, his finger moved her moist opening. He probed her pussy and knew, as well as he knew his own name, that once he entered her, once she branded him with her heat, he’d never be the same again. With her hips bucking forward, she drove his finger inside.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Jesus,” he said, loving the way the tight walls of her pussy closed over him. He’d never felt anything so divine.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Brad pressed a finger inside her, unmoving. His gaze went to her shirt. “Didn’t I tell you to take your top off?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Yes, but—”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Shh,” he silenced with a frown. “Don’t question me. Just do as I say.” His glance went to the box of toys a second time. “Otherwise, you’ll be punished.”</p>
