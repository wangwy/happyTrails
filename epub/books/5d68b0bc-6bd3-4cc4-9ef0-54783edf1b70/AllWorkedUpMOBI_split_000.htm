   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Tired of aspiring actors using her to get close to hermovie producerfather, Candace Steele has sworn off relationships. At least until she’s achieved her dream of restoring an old inn on the outskirts of Mason Creek. The new carpenter who’s been hired to help her create bedroom furniture designed for…endurance…is throwing a kink into her plans. Watching his athletic body pound wood is doing things to her hormones that have her rethinking her vow.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When he agreed to take the job, Marc Collins intended to keep the sexy spitfire at arm’s length. But Candace is giving him a run for his money in more ways than one. It’s tough to keep just his eyes on—and hands off—his boss’s daughter when she’s hell-bent on seducing him. And when she pulls a fast one and wins an impromptu bet, what’s a red-blooded guy to do except let her collect her winnings…all of them.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">The heat they generate melts the fresh paint off the walls. But when seeds of doubt make Candace put on her running shoes to flee, Marc will have to talk fast—and run faster—to capture her heart.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Warning: This red-hot story contains graphic sex, frank language, wet play, use of orgasm-enhancing props, and to top it all off, it’s all caught on film—just in case you missed anything the first time. </p>
