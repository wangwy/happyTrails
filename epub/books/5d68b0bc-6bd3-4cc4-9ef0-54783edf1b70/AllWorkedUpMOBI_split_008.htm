   <p class="ChapterHeading-Digital">Chapter Five</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace darted a glance over her shoulder to see if he was coming as she raced to the lake. Oh yeah, he was coming all right, and quickly closing the distance between them. A smile pulled at her and she knew if she wanted to win this race she’d better put everything she had into it. Deciding to do just that, Candace lengthened her stride, but Marc was too fast and too strong.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He caught up to her in seconds flat and hadn’t broken a sweat yet. “What exactly do you mean, winner takes all?” he asked, keeping pace beside her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You see,” she managed through labored breathing, knowing she needed to throw him off his stride the same way he’d thrown her off her game the other day. She planned to win the race using any means possible. “<i class="calibre2">When</i> I win, I’m going to take you back to the inn and show you another way to exercise.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His eyes lit. “Yeah, how?” She could see the genuine interest in his gaze.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Well there is the new Tantra chair I’d like to try out. You know, to ensure it works properly and is sturdy enough before we open the room to guests.” She watched his face change as understanding dawned. Deciding to play, to push him a little more, she added, “And then there’s the hanging sex swing, the love glider and the floor-to-ceiling pole for a little seductive dancing.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His jaw dropped and his stride slowed, his body language conveying his shock at her boldness. Or perhaps he was too busy thinking about what they could do on said equipment to focus on running. Fortunately his reprieve gave her the opportunity she needed to win. Once she reached the embankment, she stopped running and twisted around to glimpse Marc, who still stood there gawking at her, need and desire flitting across his handsome face.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He quickly caught up to her, grabbed her hips and anchored her to him, and her entire body shivered in sensual delight. He put his back to a tree and cast a glance around. “What the hell are you trying to do to me?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">There was something about the way he moved, talked and continually scanned the area that reminded her of a cop or a bodyguard. With her father’s line of work, she’d been around enough of them to pick up on their little nuances.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">But as heat poured through her and her pussy throbbed, aching to feel him again, her brain was too far gone to consider that point further. Right now all she could think about was the way his hands were touching her body, the feel of his growing arousal pressed against her abdomen. The way her mouth watered, thirsting for a taste of him.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Well, I’m trying to get you naked so I can have my wicked way with you. It’s only fair, don’t you think? After all, you’ve seen me naked.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Hot. Wet. Needy. And naked.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His eyes smoldered, as if he was remembering every delicious detail of their erotic encounter.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace wet her lips, and he watched the action very carefully as his eyes moved over her face. Candace shifted her hips, positioning his cock right where she needed it as she gauged his reactions. His hard erection told her how much he wanted this, but would he hesitate or would he go for it?</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You know. A little tit for tat…” she added for good measure.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His laugh was edgy, churning with passion. His nostrils flared, and his jaw clenched like he was fighting some internal battle. Then something came over him, a shift of some sort, and he grabbed her hand. “Let’s go.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Go?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Yeah, you won, and winner takes all, remember?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Oh yeah. I remember.” Candace’s heart began to pound, as she was both excited and frightened by the intensity she’d spotted in his eyes.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Without preamble, Marc ushered them back to the inn, up the stairs and straight into the room. Once inside, she watched him close the door, set the lock and press his back to it. Candace drew a breath as excitement coiled through her veins. God, she hadn’t seen such fervor in his eyes before. He tossed her a wild, predatory look and panned the length of her. “So tell me more about this tit for tat,” he said, his voice husky with desire.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As moisture pooled between her thighs, she stepped back and ran her hands over the Tantra chair, wondering if he caught the sweet tang of her arousal. She lifted one eyebrow. “Have you used one of these before, Marc?” She pulled out the brochure and scanned the numerous positions, her hands trembling with need. “It’s great for a thigh workout, if you’re riding on top, that is.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">The air around them charged, and her body quaked as she pictured herself on top of Marc, riding his cock with wild abandon. Then she took note of another possible position. Her on her knees, Marc’s cock in her mouth, and she knew exactly what she wanted to do first. She placed her hand on her stomach, where need gathered in a ball, and Marc’s gaze shifted to her breasts.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Before she knew what was happening, he took charge and was on her, his hungry lips on hers, his hands moving over her body, pushing, pulling, giving and taking like he couldn’t get enough of her. As much as she wanted him to take her again, pleasure her the way no other man ever had, she grabbed his hands and anchored them to his sides.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Uh-uh. I’m the winner. I get to play it my way.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You’re only the winner because you cheated.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She put her hands on his abdomen, taking pleasure in his tight muscles, and grinned. “Such a sore loser.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I’m not—”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace slipped her hand into his shorts and captured his cock, his words of protests suddenly forgotten, replaced by a heated moan. Now that she had him right where she wanted him—not a speck of hesitation on his face—she tugged at his shirt determined to find out if there could be more between them. If he was a man who could like her for who she was, because so far she liked everything about him.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She gestured with nod of her head. “I want these clothes gone, and then I want you to lie down on that chair for me. I’m in need of a thigh workout.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He brushed the back of his hands over her face and his touch went right through her. “Only if you let me undress you. I want you naked with me.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She sensed he was a man used to taking charge and taking care of others. But she wanted him to let his guard down with her so she could show him how good it was let someone take care of his needs. She was so used to men taking what they wanted that until Marc she had no idea such giving, considerate men existed.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Will you get naked with me, sweetheart?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">The vulnerability she heard in his voice tugged at her insides. When she nodded, he slipped his big rough hands under her shirt and slowly removed it, her bra quickly following. He then dropped to his knees and inched her shorts and panties down, his mouth so close to her skin she could feel his hot breath whispering over her thighs.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Once he had her naked, he stood, took a step back and just stared at her, his gaze caressing her body. “You’re so damn sexy.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace quivered under his lusty glance, her breasts swollen, hot, aching to feel his mouth. But first, she wanted to taste him, to have her wicked way with him, the way he’d had it with her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You’re still overdressed,” she murmured seductively, loving the easy intimacy between them, the way she felt so comfortable with him as she stood there completely naked. There was no shyness, no awkwardness.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With that he made short work of his clothes and moved to the chair like she’d asked. He sprawled out, the curves shaping his hard athletic body. The position accentuated his washboard stomach, his firm thighs and his beautiful rock-hard cock, which was jutting out at her, clamoring for her undivided attention.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Muscles rippling, he reached for her. “Come here, sweetheart.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Instead of joining him on the chair, Candace kneeled on the floor before him and leaned forward. She rubbed her palms along the chair’s soft suede fabric and pressed her breasts against it, stimulating her nipples. She wanted these next few minutes to be just about him.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His breathing grew shallow, and his deft fingers raced through her hair as his cock jolted. “Candace what—?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Winner takes all,” she whispered before she closed her mouth over his cock, taking as much of him in as possible but knowing she’d never be able to <i class="calibre2">take all</i> where his impressive size was concerned.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As she worked her mouth up and down his cock, she tilted her head to see him. His dark eyes smoldered and his breathing hitched as he watched her. When her hair fell forward, he brushed it back and gave her a tender smile. Candace’s heart fluttered, thrilled with the way he was studying her, concentrating on the action. Goodness, she really was an exhibitionist at heart.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She skated her tongue over his crown and tasted the pre-come on the tip. “Mmm.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her moans of pleasure seemed to trigger a reaction. He fisted her hair and lifted his hips from the chair, powering upward as he chased an orgasm. His veins filled with blood and Candace could feel his pressure mounting. She greedily drew him in deeper, loving how he responded to her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Do you like that, baby? Do you like to suck my cock?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Instead of answering she slipped her hand lower and cradled his balls. As her hand milked his rock-hard shaft, it occurred to her that being with him felt so intimate, so right. A riot of emotions erupted inside her, and she rocked forward, her pussy aching to feel him inside her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His muscles spasmed, and as she continued to take pleasure in kissing and tasting him, she could sense his tension. When her fingers stroked over his beautiful cock, she could feel herself burning up, sparks shooting through her body. He gripped her hair and began to ease her off, but she shook her head, and continued to work her tongue over his tip while she ran her hand up and down the length of him, her other hand cupping and massaging his balls.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With single-minded determination, she made one more pass with her tongue, escalating his tension. A moment later his entire body tightened and he groaned. “Oh, Christ.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His cock tightened and contracted, then he erupted and Candace opened her mouth to drink in his salty sweetness. She stayed there for a long time, lapping up every last drop. Once he stopped spasming, she glanced up at him.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Candace, sweetheart. Come here.” The urgency and emotion in his voice made her tremble.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She slid up the chair until she was positioned over him. With her legs wrapped around his waist, she leaned forward, her breasts pressed against his moist chest. He drew her mouth to his, which brought them to an even deeper level of intimacy. His kiss was so full of emotion and tenderness it was all she could do to keep herself together. He lifted her higher and took one nipple into his mouth. As he laved her tight bud, he gripped her hips and moved them back and forth, rubbing her clit over his stomach, preparing her for him. She swallowed the lump in her throat, loving the way he was prepping her, concerned about her needs.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When he groaned, she reached behind her and touched his cock, excited to find it swollen and ready to go again. She inched away, needing him inside her more than she needed air, but he gripped her hips tighter and held her still.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Concerned eyes met hers. “You’re not ready for me.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He slipped a hand between their bodies and brushed his thumb over her clit, his touch more emotional than physical. God, she couldn’t believe how considerate he was. Honestly, he was too good to be true.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When his finger met with her drenched pussy, a moan of need sounded in her throat, and she threw her head back. He grinned, his soft chuckle washing over her. “So it seems you are ready.” Then the smile fell from his mouth and something flitted over his face, something like pride, and he pitched his voice low. “I like how wet you get for me.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Frantic to feel him inside her, she tried to shimmy lower, but he held her and spoke in whispered words full of need. “Candace, sweetheart, slow down. We need a condom.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Cripes, she’d been so far gone, she hadn’t stopped to consider it. “I don’t—”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His cock probed her opening and he clenched his jaw. “I do, but my wallet is in the van.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Just then a noise on the windowsill gained their attention and they both turned. Abra jumped from his perch, and a box of condoms seemed to magically appear on the window shelf.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“When. How?” they said in unison.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace shook her head, perplexed at the oddness of it all but thankful for small miracles. “I don’t know. But right now, I don’t care.” She climbed from the chair, crossed the room and grabbed the box of condoms. She removed one from the package, and as she placed it on the crown of his gorgeous cock, he never took his eyes off her, and his hands roamed her flesh, like he needed the intimate contact at all times. Once she completed sheathing him, she slid her leg around his waist, to position herself over his shaft. With her feet planted on the floor, she lowered herself, and his cock probed her pussy.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His fingers bit into her hips, and the passion that grew in his eyes nearly stopped her heart. She loved that he wanted her every bit as much as she wanted him. She bent forward and brushed her lips over his, the position of the chair enhancing intimacy between partners.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Abra purred and Marc asked in broken words, “Uh…Candace. Should we…put the cat out?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Yes,” she whispered with effort, then sank down onto his cock, all thought of Abra forgotten.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Every ounce of bottled-up lust she had came rushing to the surface, and her need for Marc grew to insurmountable portions. She began bucking against him, riding him hard. His hands went to her nipples, where the soft pads of his thumbs circled her areolas. He spent a long time pleasuring her breasts before his big hands spanned her waist and held her tight.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Engulfed in desire, she pressed her palms to his chest and lifted herself up and down, up and down, driving his cock all the way inside her and reveling in the way his girth pressed against her walls and stroked the tiny bundle of nerves that made her delirious with want.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“You are so beautiful,” he murmured, his voice rough, and when he bent forward to run his tongue over her nipples, a shudder overtook her. She gave a broken gasp and gripped his shoulders, bringing them chest to chest.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">The rich scent of lovemaking curled around them, and Marc growled, his mouth finding hers. As he impaled her with his tongue, he cupped her buttocks and squeezed. Then his hand slipped around to the front where he stroked her with expertise. He parted her lips and sinuously circled her clit. Slow, torturous circles that nearly drove her mad with need. The man sure knew how to prolong a seduction.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As she shivered under his touch, she angled her body for deeper thrusts and her flesh moistened from the stab of pleasure. Her nails bit into his skin, and she pumped harder, her sex muscles tightening.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His eyes caressed hers with sultry heat. His gaze was dark, intense and unguarded. “Candace, baby. That’s it, sweetheart, come for me,” Marc encouraged, so in tune with her body and her every desire as he let down his shields and gave himself over to the pleasure.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She gave a throaty purr as a fine tremble moved through her. “So good…”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He pressed his finger harder against her clit and it obliterated all her control. Her soft quakes turned to heated tremors, and her body responded with a hot flow of release. She let herself go, giving herself over to Marc and to the pleasure he was bestowing upon her. As she tumbled into an orgasm, she bent forward and ran her teeth over his shoulder. He plunged deeper as her cunt pulsed and spasmed, her body going up in a burst of flames.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Marc…” she cried out, completely lost in the sensation.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As she called his name, her cream dripped down his shaft, bathing him in her syrupy arousal. Then suddenly he stilled his movements, his dark turbulent eyes met hers as he let himself go. She squeezed her cunt, absorbing every delicious tremor, and he released inside her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He pulled her in tight and she melted against him. They held each other for a long time, both breathing hard and gripping one another like their lives depended on it. A moment later she inched back and met his mouth. He kissed her deep, and her arms tightened around him, holding him impossibly closer. As she found solace in his embrace, his cock still buried inside her, she gave a contented sigh, deciding she never wanted to move, never wanted to break the intimate contact.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc shifted his mouth from hers to her neck to her ear and whispered, “That’s one hell of a chair you got yourself here.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace gave an easy laugh. “Don’t get too used to it.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He pulled back to see her and a perplexed look came over his handsome face. “No?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Nope.” She nodded toward the equipment still awaiting setup. “We’ve yet to try out the swing, and then there’s the glider and the—”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His lips crashed down on hers, and her words were lost on a moan.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With that he took her again and again. Sometime throughout the night, they put the cat outside and made their way to the mattress, where he gathered her tight in his arms and covered them with a plush blanket. A wave of fulfillment and gratification came over her, but as she drifted off to sleep, one thought plagued her exhausted mind.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc Collins was too good to be true.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As sunlight poured into the room, Marc twisted sideways to take in the gorgeous sight before him. He sucked in a tight breath, hungering for her in ways that left him confused. He perused her naked body, his cock responding with interest. Oh fuck, he needed her again, needed her so much it left him dizzy. Needed her more than he’d ever needed anyone, or anything, in fact.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He touched her arm, trailing his hand over her silky skin. She moaned in her sleep, unconsciously rolling toward him in search of his touch, his heat.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc leaned forward and lightly brushed his tongue over her nipple, watching it harden and loving the way she responded to his mouth, even in sleep. Desire twisted his insides as he trailed lower, kissing and savoring her stomach and her bellybutton until he reached her pubis.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With delicious thoughts filling his mind, he eased her onto her back, inched open her thighs and climbed between. He braced a hand on either side of her hips and pressed his tongue to her pussy, brushing her clit ever so slightly and watching the way she writhed on the satin sheets.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">So nice…</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Blood pounded through his veins as he continued to indulge in her liquid heat. A moment later her hands raced through his hair and he darted a glance upward. “Good morning, sweetheart.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Great morning,” she murmured, looking lazy, rumpled, sexy and so damn satisfied his chest puffed with pride. She nudged his head, guiding him back down. Chuckling, he went back to tasting her sweetness, and she gave a whimper of delight in response.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He ravished her with his tongue, then slipped a finger inside. Her hips came off the mattress and he could tell by the small tremors that it wasn’t going to take much to push her over. She was already incredibly aroused.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As her fingers played through his hair she drew a shaky breath. “Marc…”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“That’s my girl.” Her body tightened and she let herself go, creaming into his hungry mouth. “Mmm.” He drank in every last drop.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">When her tremors subsided, he slid up her body and hovered over her. A riot of emotions overcame him when he met her sleepy green eyes, and thought about the way she’d pushed him to let down his guard last night, to show him that he didn’t always have to be in charge.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Thanks for last night, sweetheart.” Jesus, was that his voice? Just then he heard workers milling about outside and a wicked idea raced through his mind and brought on a tremble. It was his turn to play with her.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She smiled. “Thanks for this morning.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Don’t thank me just yet.” He tossed her a mischievous grin and watched one sexy brow raise with intrigue.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Marc?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Up,” he demanded in a soft tone.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“What—?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“There is something I want you to do for me.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her eyes lit with interest, and her warm breath washed over him. “Oh yeah?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Yeah, you see that pole over there?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her gaze went from his face to the pole and she gave an excited gasp.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“I need you to show me something.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her voice thinned to a whisper. “What’s that?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Well, last night you showed me how to use the chair for exercise, so now I need to see how you use that pole. After all, if I’m going to be spending time in this room, I really should know how everything works, don’t you think?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Candace moistened her lips and her cheeks flushed pink as she slowly climbed from the mattress. “What I think is that you’re a very bad boy.” She made her way across the room, looking beautiful and naked and so alluring he nearly lost all coherent thought. As fierce possessiveness whipped through his blood, she wrapped one palm around the pole and swayed back and forth, her gorgeous breasts catching his attention.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Marc leaned back on the mattress, eager to take in the show. Warm early-morning sunlight poured in from the window and bathed her body in a golden glow. She lifted herself higher on the pole, wrapped her legs around it and slid downward. His cock throbbed to the point of pain as his eyes tracked down her body, taking in her lush softness and the way she pressed against that pole. Provocatively.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He cleared his throat. “You know, Candace, if anyone glances up here they’ll see you.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She glanced toward the window and fire lit in her eyes. Working her way back up the pole, she turned her attention back to him, and the sultry, playful look on her face rattled his insides. As a burst of warmth rushed to his heart, he knew he was done for. Completely and utterly done for.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“Tell me. Did you position it in front of the window on purpose?”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">“It’s quite possible,” she said in a breathless whisper.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He made a tsking sound and smiled at her, loving her honesty and her adventurous nature, but mostly loving the way she looked at him with pure adoration. “I think you’re a very bad girl, Candace.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Her grin turned wicked, and he could hear the underlying question lacing her voice when she said, “Then that makes us quite the team.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">
    <i class="calibre2">It sure as hell did.</i>
   </p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He looked into her eyes and saw need shining there. Intuition told him she felt the same way he did, but she was testing him, gauging his reactions as though wondering if there could be more between them. Sure they’d only recently met, but never had he reached such a deep level of intimacy or comfort with anyone before. It was as if some magical force had brought them together because they belonged to one another and were meant to be together forever.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Unable to take one more minute of her sexy act and needing to be inside her more than he needed to breathe, he climbed from the mattress, crossed the room and roughly pulled her to him. He jammed a leg between her thighs and felt her warm, wet pussy on his skin. Fuck, he loved how she was always ready for him. She locked her fingers together behind his head and kissed him long and deep.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">She gyrated against his leg and he pressed against her harder, grinding his cock into her stomach. Beautiful expressive eyes met his and she poked him in the chest, fully aware of what he was up to. “Was that little show in front of the window for you or was it really for me?” There was so much emotion in her voice, it seeped under his skin and touched his soul.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">His smile was as shaky as his hands as they raced over her. “Let’s just say it was for both of us.”</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">With that he lifted her ass, put her on the window ledge and pressed her back against the pane. “And so is this.” He quickly sheathed himself, positioned his body between her spread legs and, with one powerful thrust, drove his cock all the way up inside her. “Sweet fuck,” he murmured and knew he was in a heap load of trouble here.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">He was crazy about Candace. She was fun and wild and adventurous, and unlike any woman he’d met before. He wanted her. All of her. And not just in the bedroom.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">As her heat closed around him, he cupped her face and kissed her on the mouth. Hard.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">What was it Pamina had said to him again? Sometimes things can get quite…<i class="calibre2">messy</i>. He’d made a mess of things all right. A big fucking mess. But Candace was so damn impossible to resist.</p>
   <p class="MsoNormal">Regardless, he needed to make it right. For his sake and for Candace’s.</p>
